From a young age, Argo always felt the pull of the unknown, a stark contrast to the quiet and comfortable life most halflings cherished. While his peers were content with farming, trading, and community gatherings, Argo found himself daydreaming about forgotten ruins, ancient forests, and distant lands. He often explored the wilds near his home, sharpening his skills with a bow and learning the ways of the wilderness. The more he ventured, the more he realized that he was born for a life of adventure—a rare inclination among his kind.

As he grew older, Argo sought out more daring exploits, joining adventuring parties that would delve into small old ruins and forgotten dungeons in the region. His skill as a ranger quickly made him a valuable asset to these groups, but he rarely stayed with the same group for long. His charm and friendly demeanor made it easy to form bonds quickly, but his wanderlust meant he never felt tied to one place—or one set of companions. His adaptable nature served him well, and while he was good at getting on people's good sides, long-term relationships were a different story.

Despite the relative success he found as a dungeon-delver, most of Argo’s exploits were small-scale, and his world remained fairly narrow. That changed on his latest expedition, where, while exploring a dilapidated keep with a ragtag group of adventurers, he stumbled upon a weathered map hidden in an old chest. Unlike the usual scraps of treasure, this map seemed special—ancient, detailing the location of a hidden treasure far beyond the familiar lands he had explored. Intrigued, Argo used his network of contacts to research the map, discovering that the treasure’s location was off the coast of a place called Portown, across the sea. This discovery was the push he needed—finally, he had a concrete reason to explore the wider world.

Feeling a surge of excitement, Argo bid farewell to the land he had known all his life and secured passage on a trading vessel bound for Portown. He knew no one there, but that didn’t bother him. He knew that surely such a place would have people who are just as hungry for adventure as he was. His time in Portown would be the beginning of a new chapter in his life, one where the horizon would always be his destination.

Now, having arrived in Portown, Argo is on the lookout for companions who share his thirst for discovery. Though the treasure still calls to him, he knows that the journey ahead will be fraught with danger, and if there's one thing he's learned, it's that even the best ranger needs allies to survive the perils of the unknown.
