# The Island
We are sailing toward the location marked on the map. The whole journey took 3 days. This time was quite a bit more unsteady than the trading ship that I took to get to this region. Everyone is happy to be back on solid ground once we get to the island we were heading to.

The island is about 100 acres in area. With how many people we have, it shouldn't take us long to find what we're looking for.

We take a smaller group into the forest to try to reach higher ground. On our way, I spot trees that have holes through them, one side about the width of an arrow, the other side blasted out much wider.

We get to a location with some ruins and an archway. I notice some tracks that I don't recognize on the ground.

We hear loud sounds, and all go to investigate, coming across a battle.

# Difficult Situation
*The battle area is a 4 way intersection of paths through the forest. There are some knights and a fat merchant in combat with some lizardmen. We hear the loud sounds again and one of the lizardmen bursts apart as though hit by magic missiles, except there was no magic involved. Off in one corner of the area is something Lokar recognizes as a gate to another world.*

Lokar attempts to attack one of the lizardmen before trying to figure out what is going on, so we have been pulled into the battle. Down the left path where the loud sounds were coming from are two orcs and two goblins wielding guns (we don't know they're guns though).

After having defeated all of the lizardmen, we open dialogue with the orcs and the merchant. The orcs, who call themselves guardians, have been ordered to retrieve the same artifact we were, and the merchant has managed to retrieve it from the sunken ship. The merchant doesn't explain how he did it and was largely unhelpful in answering our questions. Eventually Kashamere became fed up with the merchant and attacked him, but the merchant decided to try to use the artifact to fight back.

The rest of us all effectively become frozen in time. The merchant discintegrates from the power of the artifact, and Kashamere is the only one moving normally, but we all perceive it as incredibly fast.

We see him zip back and forth a bunch of times, sometimes lay down and rest for a bit, then eventually he and the artifact disappear. Then, everything else returns to normal.

I follow the tracks Kashamere made and find him on the ground a ways off in the forest, and bring him back where the others heal him and give him rations.

One of the orcs takes out a device and aims it around, and eventually points in a general direction and says "the artifact is that way somewhere".

The gate opens and some more of the guardians come through.

# Discussions
They tell us about a lot of things but their main goal is clearly to retrieve the artifact. None of us know where it is (Kashamere does but we don't know that at the time), so we can't help them even if we want to, but Kashamere clearly continues stalling for time, as it seems they're waiting for something.

They offer us a bar of gold and a bar of platinum, but Kashamere keeps stalling for time, until eventually some of them go back through the portal when he says he'll hand it over if they double their offer. The other two wait around for a while, but then leave, saying they will go "set up perimeter" at the top of the island.

# Retrieving the Sunken Ship
Kashamere retrieves the artifact and we return to the pirate ship, explaining the situation to the captain and convincing her to take the pirate ship over to the area one of the knights said they retrieved the artifact from the sunken ship at, so that we can use Elendar's spells to breathe underwater in order to find the ship, use the artifact to get it back to the surface, allow the pirates to take the other valuables from the ship, and secure the artifact in the black box (which we assume is why the guardians have not come for it until now).

Celessa, who boasts about her swimming skills, goes in the water first in order to find the ship, along with a very long rope tied to a dinghy, so that we can mark where the sunken ship is. 6 hours later, the dinghy is far out in the waters, and Celessa returns to the pirate ship.

We return to shore to rest for the night, and then the next day, Lokar and Elendar dive to deal with getting the artifact to the ship and teleporting it out. We changed our plan prior to this to instead teleport the sunken ship to the pirates' cove and have it repaired there. The plan is a success, and Elendar teleports with the ship, but Lokar returns to the pirate ship to inform us that we need to head back to the pirate cove as Elendar was successful.

# The Cove, Revisit
When we reach the cove, the pirate captain tries to convince us to leave the artifact with her, since the merchants' guild, according to her, does a lot of underhanded and evil things. She is able to convince Kashamere, but not the rest of us.

We come to the agreement that we will bring the pirate captain with us to talk with the merchants about arranging a deal. For some reason, she doesn't end up talking with them despite coming with us. The merchant seems very nervous when we give him the artifact without the black box. (the black box was clearly the thing that prevented the "guardians" from being able to locate it)

As we are leaving, we hear some muffled shouting from the room we discussed the reward with the merchant in. Going back in, we see some other pirates trying to snuff him out.

This leaves Celessa and Elendar upset with the pirates, but we stopped them from killing the merchant.

# Portown, Revisit
After all of these events, we go rest at an inn. We split the reward for returning the artifact, so I obtain 2000gp.

We have been staying in Portown for a few more days. One day, there's a strange fog covering the whole region. We come across a fisherman who cries out that his fishing boat was pulled out to sea by some dark shadows in the water. He believes it to be related to something called "The Deep", as he somehow had a map that pointed to such an area, and had a premonition that he needed to give it to us. He said he heard whispers in his mind that said the fog was related, and that there are ancient ruins at the Deep that it points to and needs to be investigated.

A sailor who overheard took a look at the map and told us that it's in a dangerous area of the sea that sailors tend to want to avoid, called the Forbidden Zone.

# Searching for a Crew
We inquire with sailors and merchants, but, as expected, they aren't keen on taking us there and are charging a high price for it. So instead, we go and request the service of the pirate crew we just returned with. I show them the map we got, explain that it is the location of ancient ruins, and that there might be treasures, and we agree on a hire price of 600 gold, and that they get a 10% cut of the treasure.
