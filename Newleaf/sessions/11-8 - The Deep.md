# Sailing
We have set sail toward the Deep with the pirates. In this time, we've discovered that the pirate captain uses a very unfamiliar sword-fighting style but is able to hold her own quite well.

As we get closer to our destination, the pirates seem to get more and more nervous, frequently pointing out dark shadows in the waters around the ship, as the sounds we hear become more and more mysterious.

A fog rolls in and we can barely see anything. The captain turns on a magic device that beams a light forward from the front of the ship which quite literally burns through the fog. Despite this, the fog keeps getting thicker, to the point that it becomes hard to breathe.

Suddenly, we come to an end of the fog, and we can clearly see an island off in the distance. Celessa pulls out a spyglass and looks at the island through it, and describes it.

# Beyond the Fog
*It looks lush but also covered in more fog. The clairvoyant abilities of the magic telescope project sounds of unusual creatures, unfamiliar birds.*

Suddenly, the pirate in the crow's nest calls out a large creature in the water ahead. The captain tells the pirates to stop the ship.

*Suddenly, the ship tilts to the side with great force, and then returns to normal. It was almost as if the water itself was attacking.*

The pirate in the crow's nest shouts that the creature disappeared, but then spots a whirlpool to the port side. The captain says to move forward at full speed, and the crow's nest pirate calls out that it's moving with us.

The captain gets the crew to ready the longboat, and tells us that she recognizes this as the workings of a portal of water, that makes it possible for the water itself to attack whatever it perceives as a threat. She wants us to take the longboat from here because it's small enough that it won't be seen as a threat, but the main ship must return outside the fog and drop anchor.

*We all get into the long boat and Lokar rows us toward the island as the main ship retreats beyond the fog.*

# The Island
*As we approach, we begin to be able to make out the details of the island; dense vegetation, stone ruins, a large sandy beach. Among the ruins are large statues of elven women with many tentacles instead of arms and legs.*

As we set foot on the island and walk toward the ruins, a group of three creatures, similar in likeness to the statue, approach us, clearly not friendly, speaking in a foreign language. None of us are able to communicate with them, and while they don't seem immediately hostile, they try to get us to sit down and let them surround us while one of them runs off into the trees. Meanwhile, the ones that remained drew a circle in the sand around us.

After a while, a more scholarly-appearing one (the rest look somewhat like tribal warriors) walks over and asks us what we are doing here. He tells us that most people come for treasure, and that stepping outside of the circle will prove our intentions--that we will be stricken down by their god if we are lying about our purpose of trying to resolve the problem of the invisible something that stole the old man's boat.

We all step outside of the ring without dying and he begins to act friendlier, offering us drink and telling us that we are free to move as we wish, but that the center of the island is off-limits for the natives.

As we move through the ruins, we pass by a pool of water, which glows as Elendar passes by it. He looks off-put for a second, then states that it showed him an indescribable creature deep below the island. He also notices some runes that he thinks he could decipher on monoliths around the ruins, but says it would take some time.

The scholar tells us that they know of it, and that it may be what we are looking for. However, he knows no further information about how to reach it or what it is.

We all decide to rest until dark since it's blisteringly bright and hot, and Lokar decides to keep watch in case the less-enthusiastic locals try anything. However, despite recognizing we have rested until it should have been dusk, it appears that the Sun has not moved at all in the sky.

During the time we were resting, Elendar deciphered the runes on the obelisks, and was able to determine that they convey mythology about the island: something that occurred in the past offended the gods, who cursed the island to sink into the ocean.

# The Center of the Island
We decide to move toward the center of the island. As we do, we come across another statue, this one depicting an octopus-like humanoid creature. Elendar tells us that it resembles an illithid, but that he has never seen one that would have been that large or with that many arms.

I lead the group through these ruins as the terrain seems unsafe. We manage to pass through areas that look quite dangerous safely as I direct the others where to step. The deeper we go, the darker and more evil the aura around becomes.

We enter an open area, and suddenly, two statues that look more like normal illithids come to life and block our path. We begin to battle them.

They hit fast and hard. A few of us are quickly brought within inches of our life, but Elendar is able to restore us completely to health.

After a grueling battle, we are able to proceed forward and we come to a room with more monoliths. After spending time deciphering them, Elendar says that they write about the creature he saw in the vision earlier, stating that the monoliths keep it, which it describes as a leviathan, sealed and that releasing it would mean mass destruction.

# The Monoliths
Specifically, there are three monoliths in this room, and one of them looks significantly weathered from water leaking and dripping into the chamber from directly above it. Kashamere says that the two that are still in good condition have very intricate magic running through them.

He attempts to repair it with various spells, but just as he starts, we see a vision of an indescribable creature, and then Celessa attacks me, hitting me even harder than the statues from earlier. As that happens, another creature appears at the entrance of the room, and the water in the room takes on form on its own and engulfs Kashamere. It seems that as that happened, whatever came over Celessa to attack me wore off and she came to her senses.

The living water recedes for a moment, but when Kashamere tries to repair the monolith again, the water suddenly grabs me and starts pulling me in. Everyone except for Kashamere grabs on to me and manages to wrest me free.

Kashamere attempts to use some magic items to repair the monolith and it seems to have a minor effect this time. The area begins to look more stable and the dark aura in the area recedes.

While he is able to repair it slightly, he is unable to fully restore the monolith, and we can all tell that it will require someone more specialized and more time.

There are some magical items left behind by people that had come here previously but died before being able to return. We collect them and head back outside.

We return back out and report about the monoliths to the natives here. It still looks like noon with the Sun directly overhead. The scholarly one from earlier informs us that there are similar settlements with similar seals on other islands, but that he doesn't actually know where they are and cannot help us further. Upon hearing that we intend to send a more specialized group, he says that he will enforce the same test on them, just as with us.

# Returning
We get back in our longboat and return through the fog. When we emerge from the fog, it is night. After sending a signal for the pirates, we all return to Portown.

Upon arrival in Portown, the townsfolk treat us like heroes. It seems that the issues had only piled up during our trip and that they were hoping for our success and safe return.

The pirate captain takes one of the items we we found as total payment in replace of the initial agreement of gold.

I take a magical spear that we found (details in [character sheet](/character/Argo.md)).
