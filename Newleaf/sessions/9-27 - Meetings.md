# Portown
>I have just arrived in Portown, after journeying across the sea. I'm looking for some people to come treasure hunting with me, so I head to a local tavern to see if there are any skilled locals who would be interested. There are rumors that a ship called the *"Sapphire Serpent"* that was carrying about 20 people disappeared off the coast. Seems there's a merchant named *Aran Goldfinch* whose expensive goods were stolen by pirates.

`The particular item the merchant is worried about is a magical artifact inside a small black chest, which could be dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands.`

There appears to be a group of some other people who are searching for the artifact in question. I have a feeling this may be related to the treasure map I obtained, so I establish contact with them via a barmaid. We exchange greetings and I talk to them a bit about where I'm from and my experience that could help them (as both a shipwright and as someone who has already become somewhat acquainted with various people in this town), and then we enter the underground tunnels, which only I of the group was privy to the knowledge of.

Skeleton finger guy gives each of us some sort of riddle.

We come to the exit of the tunnel and there's a weak ladder down to a cove. I'm the only one that can safely climb down it as it is, so Kessa gives me a rope to reinforce it with.

# The Cove
I go down to the bottom, into the cove, and I see a ship docked in front of me. The others come down and join me. The magically-inclined among us determine that there are pockets of magic scattered about.

We don't actually know what they do, but we can't do anything as far as going toward the ship without running into them. We take turns over the course of a few minutes and eventually each interact with the pockets of magic.

Upon doing so, we each discover that the ship's location was an illusion, and that it's a bit farther down the coast of the cove. We each realize the illusion, and then are surrounded by pirates we could not previously percieve.

The captain among them is sensible, but thinks we should not be allowed to leave alive, so we come to an agreement that I share my map with them as it could be related, and we all share in the treasure and reward for returning the most important articles.

She says we will be setting sail at dawn.
