# Course of Action
>We are still in Tannenbrook, trying to figure out what to do about the artifact.

Joseph goes and meets with Grace about the subject of the artifact as well as the church in Hamburg and the Temple of Delights. She tells him that she will do what she can to sort out those issues and that we should head to Covington for now.

Helsing says that we should probably head to Drybones to deal with the new evil faction that moved in after the group was there previously, in part to separate ourselves from the countess, but he also worries that the countess could be relevant to the danger at Drybones.

We ultimately decide to go to Covington without informing the countess. We also decide to take Eliel with us, to train her in the ways of the monk.

This necessitates that we procure more horses, as our group only has 2 horses, a mule, and a cart. For ease of travel, we buy 2 horses and pack the cart with provisions.

It's around noon when we leave Tannenbrook. We head west toward the coastal city of Covington. Just before we leave, Helsing intentionally sends a letter via post, rather than courier, telling the countess that we have another matter we need to attend to for a while.

# On the Way to Covington - Part I
After we had been travelling for 4 days, we arrive at the county of West Farthing. We come over a hill and see a town in the distance. Joseph and Aster ride ahead to scout out the place. As we catch up to them, they inform us that it appears to be an agricultural town called Downing.

We stable our mounts and the cart and head to the inn. Helsing pays the innkeeper 1gp, a tip when he asked for only 8sp. 3sp per room and 1sp for a bath for the room. 2 rooms.

We gather for dinner at the inn. A rough looking man comes over and knocks on the table, then says "is anyone up for some action?"

Joseph: "I'm married."
Helsing: "What kind of action?"

He was actually talking about poker. Helsing and I join.

I won 1 pot, it was mostly Helsing winning. I can't bluff...

We get some travel packs from the general store and continue on.

# On the Way to Covington - Part II
After another 3-4 days of travel, we come across a town by a lake, which the general store shopkeeper informed us was called Furrow. This town is about 10 times larger than Farthing.

We find inn and stable as usual and rent 2 rooms. After washing up, we head to a nearby tavern. Before that, Joseph goes to the town's temple on his own.

While in town, we head to the local adventurer's guild and take on a quest to deal with Wildlings, monsters trashing a local farm. We are told that we will be rewarded 4gp per wildling (actually 5gp per, but the guild takes a 20% cut) we slay, proof by head.

The next day, we head to the farm in question. When we get there, Joseph helps out the grandmother living there by making medicine for her, while the rest of us get to work trying to track the monsters we're after.

Joseph joins us and we go into the forest in the hills nearby, following the tracks we find. Eventually, we come across a group of 5 wildlings, and we initiate battle. They are slightly resistant to physical attacks, but my magic goes right through their defenses.

We head back to the farm and inform the residents that we have slain a group of wildlings, to which they are thankful. We split the reward evenly among us, but then Aster gives me her portion.

We spend one more night at the inn and then set out to finish our journey to Covington.
# Covington
After a few more days of journeying, we reach the coast, and as we continue north along the road, a massive city comes into view along the coastline. With a population of around 18000 people, this is one of the largest cities I've ever seen.

The city of Covington is situated around a hill along the coastline, and there's a large fortified castle at the top of the hill, and a tall wall surrounding it. Being a coastal town, the port is booming, and they seem to have trade ships coming in from and going out to various places.

We ask someone on the street of a nice place to stay for a few nights, to which we are pointed toward the Defiant Rose Inn.

We make our way to the inn, and meet the namesake innkeeper, Rose. A somewhat more expensive place, we pay 1gp per room for the full package.

We check out a play at the city's playhouse, then head to a tavern nearby called the Golden Goose.

# Covington Monastery
The next morning, we head to the chapel and are led to the inner sanctum. We inform one of the priests walking around that we need to arrange a meeting with the high priest to discuss a matter of imminent danger, at the behest of Grace. We are informed that they will make time for a meeting with us at their earliest convenience.

After waiting and chatting amongst ourselves for a while, a stern old man approaches us. Recognizing that he is the high priest, Joseph bows, and we all follow suit, then introduce ourselves. After that, Joseph debriefs him on the situation of the church in Hamburg and the how the succubus Kelaseth, who claims to be the Kelaseth of lore, sealed by the church and now free, has taken residence in the Temple of Delights, turning it into a disgraceful place.

He also informs the high priest about the countess and how she informed the group about the artifact that supposedly prevents the mind control of the entity, then hands the artifact over to him. The high priest doesn't recognize it. Additionally, Joseph informs him about how they saw the mayor of Hamburg coming from the Tower of Delights.

The high priest leads us into a side room, where he plans to scry for information. There is a woman already in the room, who the high priest introduces as Brianna the Lightbearer, who we had heard about at various points on the way from Tannenbrook.

Joseph, the high priest, and Brianna scry together for a while. After a few minutes, we see all of them get thrown back after appearing to be struggling. Clearly now no longer casting the spell, they begin discussing what they saw.

They report to us that scrying gave them a sense of a great, dark evil, and they saw a keep with monsters and a dungeon with catacombs, and a sealed room with a sarcophagus emanating a malevolent evil. They see the sarcophagus open and a hand reach out from within, and then they all feel a very strong force.

All of us except for Joseph are led out and told that they will be kept a while for a cleansing.

# Mages' Guild
While we are waiting for Joseph to be released, we hear tell of a Mages' Guild, so we go and visit it.

Unsurprisingly, Helsing and Aster sense a lot of magic here. I notice that there's a somewhat strange sensation, but I don't actually understand it.

We enter, and Helsing goes to the library section to inscribe spells. I, as a shadowsworn, can't do so, and none of the scrolls they have to offer are particularly useful for me, so I don't get anything.
