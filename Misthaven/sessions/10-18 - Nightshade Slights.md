# Meeting with the Constable
*A constable comes to us and wishes to speak to us in private. He tells us that there has been a strange series of deaths, patterning all females with questionable reputation, all either patrons or workers at the same tavern, the Rowdy Wench. 6 victims over 2 months, spread out in that timespan. The information about this is not widespread, and any official information about their deaths was covered up, saying it was due to disease. However, official autopsy actually shows they all died of fright. It also seems they all entered rigor mortis immediately upon death.*

We ask to examine a body from one such case, so he leads us to the morgue. It is very cold inside. There are slabs, 6 on each wall, with bodies on some of them. 4 bodies in all, covered by cloths. He says that one of them is related, and pulls back the cover on the body in question.

*Her mouth is open, and her face is contorted with horror.*

The man tells us that through analysis, they have determined that it was caused by a necromatic power that sucked out their lifeforce.

> Aster asks about what the incidents all have in common.

The man tells us that at all scenes, there were traces of magic leading to some sort of crypt underground, but that there was no more information than that.

Gabriel believes that this was caused by a Nightstalker, a type of undead shade. However, each one of us recognizes that the series of cases is far too specific for it to be a normal Nightstalker. As well as that, none of the bodies were hidden at all, seemingly actually purposefully left in the open. We surmise that it's being controlled by someone who has something against that specific tavern.

# Rowdy Wench Tavern
We decide to try using Aster as a decoy to see if we can draw out the Nightshade to attack. Aster gets dressed like a commoner and we head to the tavern at night.

While Helsing and Aster get some drinks, I look around the room for anyone that looks particularly attentive. The ones I make note of are the people by the wall playing poker, a corner booth where there appears to be a bodyguard protecting a couple, and someone hiding his face in the corner, looking out into the room.

A fancy looking man named Faraday comes over and starts sweeting up Aster, and then they go dance.

A rowdy pair of men come over, but they don't try to start a fight or anything, so I offer a seat since they were looking for one. They clearly are sizing me up, but I caught them off guard with the invitation so they seem to be hesitant to pull anything. They are clearly unsavory types, but I don't have any problems with them as long as they don't get aggressive. Well, they weren't, but...

Faraday and Aster come back to the booth and the unsavory guys try to start a fight to get with Aster, but Faraday and I fight them off, knocking one of them out.

I ask the thug and Faraday if they know anything about the three people I noticed earlier. The thug tells me the guy of the couple is a pimp, but the name doesn't match up. Faraday tells me the Aragorn-looking guy is a ranger. He arrived here just a few days ago. Gabriel gets back and tells us we are looking for a person named Malachi Voss. Faraday tells us that he's a gang boss that frequented this tavern until recently.

Faraday says that if we want to get more information, we should talk to some smugglers who have connections to him.

# Smugglers
Faraday leads us out and down to another place on the wharf, to a building that has boarded up windows and such. We go in and come across a room with some people sitting at a table. There is an armed man in the corner.

Gabriel unsurprisingly asks to see the wines, and buys four of the finest bottles and has them delivered to the inn. Then, he puts some extra payment on the table and asks for them to arrange a meeting with Voss. The smugglers look reluctant, but say they could be persuaded to tell us how to contact him.

After handing over some more coin, they tell us that we should go to an abandoned church in the graveyard.

# Graveyard
All of us then go to the graveyard at night. Since it's very dark, I guide us through the graveyard since I have darkvision. Eventually, we come across an old, overgrown, boarded up church. All of the doors are covered in vines which my companions say emanate magic. Likely a trap of some sort.

We go around the church and see more of the same. Gabriel lights up the wall we are at and we see a magic inscription on the wall. He reads it and says that it says "enter". We all say the magic word while touching the inscription.

# Inside the Church
We end up in a dungeon cell of some sort. All of us are chained up against a wall. I try to escape the chains, but can't make any progress. Meanwhile, Aster manages it easily. Lighting up the area, she sees that we are in a cell, and that there are cloaks hanging on the wall just outside of the cell. She reaches and manages to grab a hold of one of the cloaks. She pulls a scroll from its pocket, and reads the arcane inscription on it. She keeps saying kcolnu, but it doesn't help us any. Eventually, I realize that it's backwards for unlock, and say it, but nothing happens. She then says it after I do, and our chains unlock, and we are freed.

Faraday, who is for some reason still with us, picks the lock after a few minutes, but it takes long enough that some thugs come in and we start fighting them.

After beating them, we go the way they came from, and come out into the main room of the church. Inside, we see the Nightshade, Malachi Voss, and another thug. A battle commences once again.

We pull through, and I deal the finishing blow to Voss. The Nightshade, which was in combat with Gabriel, is no longer being controlled, and floats away. We check what Voss had on him and find a stone that is clearly evil, as well as his cloak, wand, and a ring.
