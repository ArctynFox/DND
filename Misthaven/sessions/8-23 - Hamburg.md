# Arrival in Hamburg
`The mayor of Hamburg is Leonard de Cranston.`

>The existing party arrives in Hamburg and inquire with a local for a stable for their mule, as well as places to eat and rest. He tells them to check the Fairway Inn to stay at, as well as the Curious Dog Tavern. They go to the Fairway Inn, which conveniently has a stable for the mule out back.

After a few days of travel, I arrived in Hamburg, and headed to a local inn for shelter and food, as well as to gather information. While there, I was seated with a group of three people: Gabriel van Helsing (his name precedes him), priestess Aster Ethaimia, swashbuckler Garcia Flynn, and cleric Joseph Arivagus. After becoming acquainted with them, the waitress walks behind me and quietly tells me that I should check out a man named Mick who deals in underhanded wares at the Curious Dog. Since my new acquaintances also had business at the Curious Dog, I led them there.

# The Curious Dog
`The Curious Dog looks like a stereotypical saloon.`

>Astrid goes over and pulls out a violin to join the pianist in making music. The rest of us all sit at one table.

Suddenly, Joseph lunges out at a girl who walks by, quite uncharacteristic of a priest. It seems she's stolen his coin purse. I speak to the girl, named Eliel, since she seems just the type of person to be involved with the underhanded people I'm looking for. I ask her where I can find Mick, and she fearfully points behind me, to a corner of the room, where there's a wealthily-clothed man with two large bodyguards. Knowing my own abilities, I go over to these guys and inquire if a pocketwatch has passed through his hands. He asks me how much the information is worth, and I convince him to sell the info to me for 20sp. He tells me that a person nicknamed Slash Morone obtained one recently, but that he's very attached to it.

# The Church of Hamburg
`The officials of Hamburg, including the mayor, have been bought off by people like Mick.`

Eliel follows our group to the inn, but I'm the only one that notices this. I go and talk to her alone, and she tells me that she wants to make it up to Joseph. I don't detect any ulterior motives from her behavior and words, so I send her off and tell her that maybe she'll have the chance to do so later. I go back and join the others.

The next day, we head to the local Church of the Light to see if they can provide assistance with the underhanded dealings of Mick and Slash Morone. Eliel is waiting in front and greets us, telling Joseph that she wants to make it up to him. He allows her to join us and says she may be able to find some work at the church. There is a wall around it, and the gate is currently closed. At the gate, we see a bell with a rope hanging from it and ring it. A man comes out and inquires about our group, but lets us in when he finds that we are accompanied by a priest from Misthaven (Joseph).

We wait inside the church for around half an hour, and an old man comes from deeper in to meet us. Steven, the High Priest. Joseph asks the high priest what Eliel could do for penance. To Joseph's dismay, he assigns her as his page for as long as she feels she hasn't made it up to him. He seems a bit gone, so we decide not to bring up our actual purpose in coming.

Joseph inquires as to why the gate was locked, but doesn't receive a direct response. Instead, The priest tells us to bury the town's dead... After agreeing to do so, we leave.

Aster proposes the idea that he's been controlled by the entity. Joseph informs me that the entity is an unknown mastermind who can control peoples' minds, and he's looking for a specific holy artifact. Joseph's group came to Hamburg to gather information and find assistance to deal with the entity. Gabriel suspects a particular witch, who he thinks may actually be a vampire.

Aster writes a formal letter of request to Lady Francesca de Maul requesting to meet and inquire about the entity, seals it and entrusts it to a courier to deliver it.

# Slash Morone
After leaving the church, we head to the location Mick told me to find Slash Morone. There's a person sleeping outside the door. I wake him up and tell him I'm looking for Morone. He goes inside and someone else comes out a while later, and we are guided into a room with a table and some chairs. We wait there for a while, and then four ruffians come in and inquire as to our purpose. One of them tells me to come over, and when I do, he says I'm not worth the pocket watch (or maybe meeting with Slash? Who knows, he got on my nerves so I didn't ask.). In response, I look him in the eye and say "I'll decide that for myself". He punches me, and we start trading blows, which results in an all-out brawl between our group and the ruffians.

We come out mostly unscathed, and all the ruffians are out cold. Then, a woman, the real Slash Morone, comes in and says we're up to snuff. I ask to see the pocket watch and remain secretive in why I want it. Discovering that it is, indeed my father's pocket watch, I try to haggle for the price and we settle on 5gp.

>Gabriel asks if she has any mens' jewelry, and she takes him into another room, alone. He returns with a necklace on.

# Meeting with Lady Francesca
We all attend the festival later that night. Gabriel controls fire to put on a bit of a show to entertain people.

The next day, we are informed that we are to meet Lady Francesca at the keep. We go the keep's gate and are stopped by the guards. Aster introduces herself and shows her invitation. We are led into a parlor. There, a lady-in-waiting tells us Lady Francesca will meet us momentarily. Francesca arrives with a guard, and she sits down with us after exchanging formal greetings and bows.

After being served tea, we begin discussing the entity. The others discuss the Priest of Drybones and the Temple of Delights. Francesca informs us that the mayor has made multiple visits to the Temple of Delights, information which Aster concurs. Francesca says that Southampton is gaining some level of autonomy through means separate from the king's own accord, although she also knows that the mayor knows not to cross certain boundaries lest the royal guard get involved.

We continue discussing such issues for a while, and eventually, Francesca tasks us with travelling west to the central church of the Light. Eliel goes with us. To pay penance...

# Arrival in Tannenbrook
We end up at Tannenbrook on the way and find a place to stay. Then, at Joseph's recommendation, we check out the local church. Before that, we visit Gabriel's aunt, who allows us to stay with her.

The next day, we go to the church. We meet brother Maynard (allegedly some evil guy). Joseph and Maynard discuss the replacement of Steven, and then the Temple of Delight. Then, they inspect a poison Gabriel was infected with recently and currently suffers from.

# The Countess
Afterward, we visit countess Lorissa at a residence in a rich part of town. The particular residence seems to have a very unkept exterior. We are invited inside by a butler the others recognize as George. The interior is gothic, with many dark, neutral, and red colors. We are seated inside and the countess soon greets us. After some pleasantries, she takes us to a domed room with a pedestal in the middle and places the artifact the group retrieved recently on it. The walls of the room are covered in runes and depictions of war and death.

The countess pulls a book from the wall and begins reading it on the floor, asking Gabriel to read the arcane words with her. They are casting a spell together. After they finish the spell, Gabriel looks very disoriented. The countess asks us to come back and inform her of what our next move is once we decide on it. Once we leave, Gabriel tells us that the spell they cast was some sort of mind or soul probing spell, and that through it, he was able to get a glimpse into the countess' mind, determining that she has evil intentions with the artifact. We brought it with us as we left, so we have some time to decide what to do.
