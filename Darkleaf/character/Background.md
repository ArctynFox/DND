# Cedwyn
Cedwyn has lived in Eldoria for hundreds of years, his life intertwined with the peaceful rhythms and quiet majesty of the elven capital. From a young age, he felt a deep connection to Azura, the Goddess of Fate and Destiny, drawn to the subtle mysteries of her teachings. Unlike many of his peers who gravitated toward the more prominent worship of Corellon Larethian, Cedwyn found solace in the quiet halls of Azura's temple, seeking guidance and understanding of the intricate web of fate.

His devotion did not go unnoticed. A few decades ago, the priests of the Temple of Azura recognized Cedwyn’s unwavering faith and his desire to protect others from the encroaching forces of evil. Seeing both his potential and his heart for justice, they allowed him to take an oath to become a paladin of Azura. Unlike many Paladins who boast divine power through battle cries and righteous fury, Cedwyn's path as a paladin is one of quiet resolve, reflecting Azura's understated influence. His service is rooted in the belief that every action, every battle, plays a role in the greater tapestry of fate.

To refine his combat abilities, Cedwyn took up a position within the city guard of Eldoria, working as a protector of his fellow elves. For years, he patrolled the shimmering streets of the city, guarding its people from external threats and maintaining order. His time as a guard instilled in him not only the skills of a seasoned combatant but also a profound sense of duty and loyalty to his kin and all who walk the path of good.

His service to the city was even recognized by King Oberon, as he became knighted, given the mission of guarding the royal family.

As a Paladin of Azura, Goddess of Fate and Destiny, Cedwyn is not only bound by divine duty but is also driven by a deeply personal mission.  
  
Years ago, Cedwyn's younger sister mysteriously disappeared while on a pilgrimage to one of Azura’s sacred shrines. Haunted by this loss, Cedwyn always believed that her disappearance was linked to a darker manipulation of fate. Recently, while following leads about her fate, Cedwyn uncovered clues pointing to the involvement of the Twilight Covenant—the very cult threatening to plunge the world into darkness.  
  
A surviving witness from that pilgrimage described shadowy figures resembling cultists of Xalvador, who spoke cryptically of an "offering" for a twisted ritual. The cult’s goal of warping the flow of destiny could explain why Cedwyn's sister vanished without a trace—her fate stolen, manipulated for a sinister purpose.  
  
This battle is now deeply personal. By joining the heroes of Darkleaf, Cedwyn seeks not only to stop the cult’s plans but to uncover the truth about what happened to your sister. There’s a chance she may still be alive, or her fate may be tied to the dark ritual the cult plans to unleash.  
  
Cedwyn believes that fighting alongside the group will be the key to discovering the truth and setting his sister’s destiny, and the world's, back on its rightful course.

# Eldoria
Eldoria, the ancient and glittering capital of the Elves, is a breathtaking city, renowned for its beauty, history, and mysticism. Nestled deep within the heart of an enchanted forest, the city blends seamlessly with the natural world, as if grown from the very land itself. Towering white spires of silverstone rise from the canopy, their elegant forms intertwined with ancient, sky-reaching trees that have stood for millennia. Light seems to dance across the marble streets, reflected from the intricate crystal inlays that shimmer underfoot, casting soft rainbows in the air.

At the heart of Eldoria lies the great palace of Oberon, King of the Elves. Its walls are woven with vines of silver and gold, and its vast halls are lit by orbs of glowing starlight, created by the elves’ mastery of magic. A place of diplomacy and power, the palace has been the center of elven rule for centuries, where decisions that shaped the fate of the world were made.

The city itself is a wonder of craftsmanship and magic, with bridges that float above the rivers and stairways that spiral up through trees without disturbing their natural growth. The elves of Eldoria have long lived in harmony with their environment, and every aspect of the city reflects this. Gardens filled with rare, glowing flora line the streets, and fountains of crystal-clear water flow endlessly, their waters imbued with gentle healing properties.

Temples to Corellon Larethian, God of Magic, stand as sacred places of worship and learning, their serene courtyards filled with scholars and priests. The city’s libraries are legendary, holding scrolls and tomes detailing the ancient history of the elves, as well as knowledge of arcane arts, nature, and the stars.

Despite its outward serenity, Eldoria is a place of deep wisdom and quiet power. Its people, though graceful and peaceful, are not without strength, for they have defended their lands against countless threats over the centuries. Beneath its glittering surface lies a history of battle, sacrifice, and the enduring will of the elves to protect their ancient legacy.

In the elf capital, the worship of Azura, Goddess of Fate and Destiny, is a quieter, more introspective faith, practiced by a smaller yet devoted following. Her temple, modest compared to the grand shrines of more prominent gods, is tucked away in a secluded corner of the city. Built from pale stone and adorned with subtle celestial motifs, the temple reflects the understated nature of her worship. Though not a major religion, Azura’s priests are sought by a select few—scholars, diplomats, and those who understand the delicate balance of fate. They come seeking quiet counsel or subtle glimpses into the future, trusting in the goddess’s unseen hand to guide pivotal moments. While public ceremonies are rare, the faithful hold private observances where they meditate on destiny’s winding paths, ever mindful of Azura’s quiet influence on their lives.
