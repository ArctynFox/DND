**Aura**: Strong divination
**Caster Level**: 14th
**Price**: 60,000 gp
**Description**: This simple, silver ring bears the symbol of Azura. When worn, the ring allows the Paladin to subtly influence the strings of fate.
**Fate's Boon**: Three times per day, the wearer can grant an ally or themselves a +4 luck bonus to any single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check after the roll has been made.
**Destiny's Call**: Once per week, the wearer can alter the outcome of a major event. This ability allows the Paladin to ask Azura for a vision that shows one possible future outcome. This grants a **divination** spell (85% success) that is far more detailed, revealing exact outcomes and potential consequences of a decision or action within the next hour.
