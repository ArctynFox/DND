# Introduction
>I put a message in with King Oberon to request permission to meet with the heroes of Darkleaf. It's been a while since then and the heroes have finally ended up in the court room, and I have been invited.

Once introduced by King Oberon, I explain my mission and my reason for wishing to join the heroes. After explaining my skills, they decide that it would be best for themselves as well to bring me along for my defensive and healing capabilities.

King Oberon as decreed that he wants the king of Portent dead. The plan is to sneak in using invisibility.

# First Visit to Darkleaf
Before we begin such an operative, however, I go with the heroes back to Darkleaf, which they tell me has grown significantly. It's quite a melting pot, and the people there seem fairly open and honest.

Doc, the goblin, crafts accessories. Sage, daughter of King Oberon, who I am tasked with protecting, requested of him to make an accessory using some diamonds.

# Temple of The One
Caleb, a priest of The One, is summoned to the temple of The One in Darkleaf, and is tasked with, coincidentally, a similar mission as I have: to route out the evil in Portent. He requests that we go with him, and an angel-like woman whisks us to a location that none of us have ever been to.

*We see a flat plain surrounded by mist, with town and many people flying around. It is a place of reverence to The One, on and surrounded by mountains.*

We are greeted by the Grand Meister. He informs us that the temple has been taken over by people who wish to turn away believers, rather than welcome them. He passes a glowing light to each of us, and though I do not know exactly what it is, I recognize it to be a symbol that The One approves of my presence. The Grand Meister says they are "truth embodied, the presence of The One". I cannot accept, for I act in accordance with Fate, but I vow to do what I can to assist for the sake of good. Caleb and Stardust accept, and Sage declines. Doc, who Caleb brings one back to, accepts.

# Travelling from Darkleaf
We are suddenly attacked by some invisible creatures. Sage notices as the attack is made, telling us all to scatter. We do so, and then get hit by waves of lightning and flame. Stardust is completely downed before being able to act, and I am injured within inches of my life. Doc disappears completely.

I get hit by another wave of lightning and go down. So much for protecting Sage, I was the one who was defeated first, without even being able to carry that out.

After a few seconds, I come to, feeling a lot better, as Stardust has restored me mostly back to health.

As I come to my senses, I recognize the corpses of two dead stone giants around us. I also see a cloud of mist in the sky about 100ft away and 100ft up. I see Caleb fly up to it and disappear in the mist.

Sage fires some arrows at it but they bounce off.

Stardust casts Fly on me and I join Caleb.

Suddenly, a ray of acid flies out from an unknown location and hits the dragon, and the dragon immediately starts retreating at full speed.

Sage begins firing arrows at Caleb suddenly.

We realize she is being controlled by the dragon, so Caleb solemnly kills her and then revives her, then restores her to get rid of the negative levels.
