# The Infiltration
We took a few days to recover from the battle with the dragon and stone giants, and then Doc created four Stoneskin Potions for us.

We end up traveling to Portent, and Doc uses stealth to investigate on his own. He is aided by various items on his person, though I know not the specific details.

He reports back, telling us that it seems people are free to enter the outer courtyard, and that there's some sort of market as well as a slave trade. There are magic walls around the castle itself preventing things like teleportation and scrying. In some pens behind the castle are knolls and a red dragon. There are human and knoll guards around. They appear to be protecting completely full slave pens, mostly elves but also various other races.

Eventually, we decide to infiltrate silently by using disintegrate on an area that appears to be less-guarded, so that we can get in undetected.

Sage, being made invisible by a spell from Stardust, investigated the area alone. When she came back, she reported that she got some information by threatening some people, and that we are actually on the opposite side of the castle from where we need to be.

We go back out and Stardust disintegrates another roof, and Sage once again investigates. She comes back, saying she recognized a room that is almost certainly the king's room.

Stardust creates a dimensional door into said room, and everyone walks through silently, except for myself, who accidentally makes the loudest possible sound walking through a door could make.

The king in the bed, as well as Shera who is also with him, were woken up, but still not thinking properly. The guards outside started trying to get in. We all gang up on the king and Shera, killing them before anything else can happen, take their heads, and leave before the guards can get in.

We fly back out through the hole Stardust made, and then she teleports us back to the elven throne room.

# Reporting In
Some of the guards recognize us and get the king for us. The king comes in and he tells us that we will now go into battle, given the description Doc gave of the knolls and the dragon, and the slaves.

The king tells us to rest, as the clerics will create a gate to go to battle in the morning.

# Resolution
With a force of about 1000 elves, we attacked the castle, and succeeded with overwhelming victory.

Two guards came out of the castle and surrendered to us, saying that they have rounded up all the people that supported the king. Some of them are evil, some of them are not, some even among the guards that have captured them are evil, and some are not.

The captured people will be held according to elven law.

They bring out the king's brother, Dewall, age 14, who opposed the king and was locked up for quite a while. We explain the situation to him. The Dewall is named the new king, first of his line, and Caleb is titled Regent.

We are informed that the elven slaves were all brought from the town of Steepvein.

King Oberon arrives, informing us that the other kingdoms have been informed of what happened. We are also informed that the Dwarves want to make amends for the millenium-long conflict with the elves. King Oberon also says that the enslaved elves are to be freed and henceforth treated with the same respect as a member of the royal family, and that they should be provided home and work.
