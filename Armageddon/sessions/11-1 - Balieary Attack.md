# The Baliearies
*The Baliearies are wreaking havoc while approaching the Plaza of the Seven Gates.*

We meet up with Amra at the plaza. Jarod summons some Frost Giants to help us.

Andrea uses *the* axe to blind the Baliearies temporarily, creating a bright flash of light that floods the mile radius with light. We then all initiate combat proper.

One of the Baliearies immediately creates a pyroclastic flow storm in a 200 ft radius, causing constant damage and impeding vision.

I cast wish to allow us all to see through the flow, and we continue the battle.

After a tough battle, we come out victorious. Intending to carry out the task the queen sent us on, Greyfalcon takes us to the Bifrost so we can travel to the past to find Stardust.

# The Past
We end up at Eclipto Bay on Thalassar in the past and head to the temple. We inform the people there that we need to speak to Stardust, who, as last the group knew, was at this time period. They say that they haven't seen her in a while, so we go to an inn to rest for the time being.
