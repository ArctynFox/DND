# Battling the Crystal Colossus
We are on a long road in the middle of massive ruins, presumably a city. Around 300 ft ahead of us is a giant humanioid crystal construct, which immediately starts rushing toward us. We intercept.

Andrea grants Amra stoneskin and then teleports up onto the construct's back. Greyfalcon and I fly into the air to gain a slight advantage in the situation. Amra rushes forward and tries to hit it, but his weapon bounces right off of its crystal leg. I attempt to disintegrate it, and, though it does not have a great effect, it seems to react to it. It then slams down onto Amra with a force that makes Amra flinch, so I create a wall of force between Amra and the upper half of the creature so that only the 10 feet above the ground can be passed at.

After a grueling battle, we finally defeat the construct and it collapses into ore fragments including adamantine. We collect the adamantine and then follow Greyfalcon to a location he said seemed interesting when he saw it from the air during the battle.

# Investigation
This city appears to have been in ruins for a long time. Though the buildings are made of stone, they are crumbling like ancient structures. vines, trees, and other plants break through the stone in droves, and the area has been long reclaimed by nature in both flora and fauna.

We come across the location in question and see a mural depicting a war. The creatures battling in the imagery appear humanoid. Stardust leads us through a corridor into a stadium-sized library. She says that this place was lost to all.

There is a statue of a kingly man, holding two open scrolls in one hand; in the other hand is a depiction of Andrea's own Axe of Gantos.

# Relics of the First Age of Armageddon
Stardust says that she can read the bottom scroll, however some passages have been removed, through unknown means, likely at the time that this place became abandoned.

Andrea takes a closer look at the other scroll and realizes it is in primordial.

"The power of Gantos ebbs strongly from stone; stone of Dark Heart is bound to city; all fate of city is bound together. Only one ruler can hold this power, and the stone shall only ever have one master; when one is birthed, their wills will clash and one shall live while one will die."

Through this, we assume that the Dark Heart forces this to occur; however, the issue is not as simple as destroying or removing it. First of all, this was something created by Gantos himself, and is unlikely to be affected by anything we could do. Secondly, it keeps dark forces out of Armageddon as a form of protection.

We have a long discussion about the implications of this and how we can save both Amber and Ambrosia. Eventually, Stardust speaks up and says that Amber will have to be put into stasis.

This leads into even more discussion about whether this is Loki's involvement in the upcoming events and whether we can use this to force his hand and tie him to a purpose, so that he can't act as the snake he typically is.

# Returning
Our discussion was not coming to any sort of conclusion, so we decided to stick with a prominent plan that Jared wants to attempt, and then follow Stardust back to Eclipto Bay. From there, we go back to the Bifrost and return to our own time.

Jared goes to try his method, being secretive about it and not letting us go with him. However, when he returns to us, he says that it was unsuccessful as Amber is apparently already in a form of stasis. We surmise that it was Loki's doing, and that her being put to sleep was the onset of it.

We report to Braxton about all that we have learned, resigning to the fact that Armageddon will most likely be locked in war with droves of undead for years to come. As we are talking, Andrea becomes suspicious, and uses a trick question on Braxton. Realizing he has been found out, he reveals himself as actually being Braxton, and admits that he put Amber into stasis.
