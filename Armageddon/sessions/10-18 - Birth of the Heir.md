# Valkyrie Appearance
*We've been invited to meet the queen of Armageddon who is going into labor, to celebrate the birth of the heir to the throne. As we gather and begin walking inside, John notices that the Bifrost is being used in the vicinity. It appears, and a Valkyrie comes out.*

The Valkyrie introduces herself as Godiva, sent by Tyr. She pulls out a scroll that Greyfalcon recognizes as the True Authority. She reads from it and says, "Loki must partake in the upcoming war because his existence depends on it. Trust him at your own peril; his needs make him predictable. Forces outside of Loki's power brought you together and things were set in motion before you arrived at Eclipto Bay. The hand of Tyr found the hand of Tyr, and... (she skips forward because she's actually trying to find a specific part)... Loki is to be considered an asset until proven otherwise, and not to be held accountable for his past deeds at Ragnar√∂k".

*The Valkyrie then leaves with the Bifrost.*

# The Birth
Over the next hour as we wait, a thunderstorm rolls in, lightning striking the towers of the city. A bell chimes, but it's mostly drowned out by the storm.

Through my knowledge of arcana, I can tell that there is an ancient aspect in the power of this storm. The rest of the party says they've never felt or seen this effect before, but that it seems related to the birth of the princess.

*We are soon led to a room near the queen, but not within range of hearing.*

After a while, the storm gets less intense, and the servants bring word that a girl was born. Later, Braxton comes in with the baby. He shows her to us all.

*Braxton is called away by a servant and looks concerned. He leaves the baby with Vestra, who is with us. A few minutes later, he comes back, and says he can't get Amber (the queen) to wake up.*

# A Curse?
We all go to the room the queen is in, and Jarod uses healing on her while detecting magic. He determines that there is magic involved, and that her metabolic rate is very slow. Using my knowledge of temporal effects, I recognize that she is under the effect of temporal stasis which is getting slower and will come to a stop eventually. Whatever power is causing the effect is unprecedented.

*Some military advisors show up and get Braxton to go with them for something.*

Andrea uses anti-magic shell to attempt to temporarily mitigate the effect. The queen wakes up for a moment, imploring us to seek Stardust.

*Braxton comes back and tells us that we need to go outside now.*

We head out of the castle and see three Baliaries attacking outside.
