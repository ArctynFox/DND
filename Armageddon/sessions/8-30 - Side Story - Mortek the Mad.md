# The Vision
> I am given a home in Armageddon as a guardian, and some servants to help out. A housewarming party is thrown, and I am given various gifts.

*About a week after I move in, I have a vision during the night. I am in the sky, and I see a landscape below me. My vision descends rapidly until a citadel is visible on a hill. My vision goes into the citadel, and I pass my various rooms, arriving at a chamber full of magical symbols and fire. There's a man there, casting a spell from a book, with magical power releasing from himself. The vision moves back outside, and I see masses of creatures and plants turning into dwarves. The transforming people are chanting the name "Mortek". The vision terrifies me, and I wake up.*

In the morning, I visit Jarod to consult about the vision. We decide to scry for "Mortek" using his druidic pool. Through scrying, I see another vision.

*I see a wintery scene, with a giant skull in the middle of a field of snow and ice and mountains. It makes my head start pounding and I stop scrying.*

I describe what I saw to Jarod and he says to investigate it at the archives.
I go to the archives and explain the situation, and the scribes begin researching for me.

# Mortek the Mad
`Those who are the most dedicated are also the most dangerous.`

Three days pass, and the scribes bring me the information they have found. They informed me that the name was found in an old tome, about 5000 years old. It stated that he was a mage that was trying to find the cause of life. Towards that end, he used any means possible, even if it meant sacrificing other lives, and the type of lives didn't matter to him. He studied both arcane and the divine, and for so long that he went mad. Eventually, he created a magic called unlife, which allowed him to create create an army to conquer, which lasted centuries, until defeated by an alliance of nations. Mortek was killed in that battle, and after he was killed, a tomb for his body was constructed over 500 years to hide the spell of unlife, so that a time may come when it can be used for good. A cult formed around his name afterward, but the location of his tomb had been forgotten.

From this information and the visions, I decide there must be some form of power urging it on. Jarod and I report this information to Braxton, who agrees that we should go and investigate, taking and protecting this spell from evil hands.

We research it with the sages, but we get no more information about the location.

I scry on my own device again, instead of Jarod's druid pool. I don't know quite where it is, but I have enough information to be able to teleport there.

# The Tomb
Jarod, Braxton and I teleport to the location I saw in my vision. We approach the giant skull, which we determine to be the tomb. I am able to determine that there's no actual danger in the tomb itself, so we all head inside.

Inside, we find a large room with constellations on the walls. There's nothing much of import here, and nothing undetectable by the eye. Everything is exactly as it seems. In the center of the room, there's a blue beam going from the floor to the ceiling. I investigate the beam and determine that it is a teleporter that takes us to another location on the same plane.

Jarod uses foresight and attempts to enter the teleporter, but just before passing through, his foresight senses danger that isn't immediately lethal but can become so. We discuss for a bit, and eventually decide to enter in the order of Braxton, Jarod, and then myself.

We enter the teleporter, and it looks like we're in the same field with the giant skull from earlier, but there's no snow, and there's no air either. Jarod casts some sort of druidic magic for him to be unaffected by the lack of oxygen, but Jarod himself is naturally unaffected and I have a Necklace of Adaptation that allows me to survive by forming a bubble of constantly fresh air around me. Looking around, we see Ghanton in the sky, and we realize we are on one of its moons.

# Tomb on the Moon
As before, I approach the tomb, noticing that this version has a magical barrier around it. Wanting to avoid danger, I first use Arcane Eye and cast Dimension Door on it to get it past the barrier. Through it, I see a similar large room to the other version, but this time, the constellations along the walls are gone and there are three humanoid, smoky whisps in chains. I also see an archway in the back that leads to a dark hallway.

Bringing the Arcane Eye back, I use dimensional door to get the three of us inside after we all buff up, and one of the whisps begins talking to us. It says that we must go through a test, but the test is something we need to discover, rather than being directly told. It says that to pass the test, we must work together. It lets us proceed through the archway, and we see darkness.

Continuing to walk forward, we reach a square room with a fount, and runes that say "the drink of life is all that be". We each drink in succession and it injures each of us. We heal up and then try drinking at the same time, and a new archway appears. We head inside and see three levers on each wall. We each pull a lever on the left wall with our left hands, and an archway at the other end of the hall which had a barrier in the way loses the barrier. We walk in and see a pedestal. We all look into the top of the pedestal at the same time.

*We see the image of an elaborate crypt coffin with skulls on it.*

The pedestal lets off the same kind of glow as the teleporter from the crypt on Ghanton, but it's split, so there's some going up from the pedestal and some down from the ceiling, but they don't meet in the middle. I can sense that they are connected together magically.

We all touch the blue glow and get teleported to a circular room which has the coffin we saw. On the ceiling of the room are constellations of the local star cluster, and it quickly narrows down to our solar system, then to the planet of Ghanton, and narrows to a continent on the opposite side of the planet from Armageddon. It then zooms down into another snowy area.

*We see a chasm with a bridge crossing it, leading up to a large face-shaped cave opening.*

Recognizing this as a dangerous dungeon, we head back to Armageddon to assemble the guardians.
