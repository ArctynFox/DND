# Eclipto Bay
We end up at a tavern near our inn and make merry. Amra takes someone away with him to get information. After some time, we return to our inn and sleep.

In the morning, Jarod comes to my door and tells me that we need to discuss something during breakfast. Quite a while after we start our meal, Stardust appears.

Stardust informs us that we need to obtain the all-key, which we, first, need to obtain in the current time period, then use it in an era of antiquity, and then return it back to where we obtained it right after we left it so that the rest of the party who retrieved it once before in the future can still have retrieved it in the future.

# The Starforge
Andrea uses some sort of celestial power to transport us to the Starforge, where the group knows that the all-key is located. Based on their knowledge of the Starforge, they tell me that we cannot do something like create a portal into the forge or teleport; the former would result in the leakage outward of fire so hot it cannot be repelled, and the latter would result in being unable to escape since the star itself has properties that nullify the release of magic. The only reason they were able to escape the previous time was because of Andrea's axe which they used to pry the door open after teleporting inside.

Unable to think of another way to deal with it, we teleport Amra and Andrea inside, having them deal with it the same way as before. After a few moments, the two reappear from the dimensional door they used to enter, with Amra holding the key.

Stardust throws down some small object, which quickly grows into a large door. Jarod says that this is the door through which we can return. We pass through it, onto a common city street, through another door into a living room where a family is eating, and then through another door, into a flat area with strange silver-clad soldiers staring into a large void with some sort of alien vessel traveling across it. We then proceed through yet another door into an ancient forest, then a ruin, and then a barren wasteland with no oxygen.

# Loki's Punishment by the Midgard Serpent
We see a completely dark sky above. Occasionally, the earth will quake. There are jutting rocks and ruins sparsely dotting the area. Stardust leads us to a chasm in the ground and leads us down into it. As we proceed downward, we begin to hear some faint screaming, the cries a voice shouting in pain for minutes on end. As this happens, the ground once again shakes. It seems that the quakes line up with the screams...

We continue downward and the screams become louder and louder. The descent steepens. The air becomes heavy, chilled. We come to an outcropping where there is a humanoid male bound to a rock, seemingly constantly healing while suffering. From above, a liquid is dripping on him once every few minutes, which signals his screaming. The liquid seems to have a strong damaging, acidic effect on him, as his skin melts away quickly with every drop, then heals him back slowly during the period before the next drop. It seems to be preventing him from regaining strength, and damaging him ever-so-slightly more with every drop. Beside him is the remains of what I can only assume was a woman, given the accessories left among a pile of bones and flesh. From The man, to the woman's body, and off to the cliff's edge, is a very well-worn-down path.

From up where the acid is dripping from, a giant, snake-like creature which begins to creep out of the darkness of a cave nearby in the wall of the crevasse. Stardust calls out to us that we need to protect and release the man being tortured and quickly.

Right after she says so, the snake approaches and stances as if ready to strike, clearly not interested in letting us do so. It spews out acid at Amra and Andrea, harming them immensely. We begin fighting it.

After a long, grueling battle, we slay the giant serpent and free the man that was tied up. However, as the man begins to regain his senses and strength, we feel a strong evil aura. Stardust tells us that she will impression him, and then we need to leave quickly. Greyfalcon surmises that the man is Loki.

We follow Stardust back through many doors, many places, many realms, and arrive back at the Starforge for Amra to return the key.

Then, we return to Eclipto Bay. As we are travelling back, Greyfalcon also pieces together that the woman's remains belonged to Loki's wife, who willingly stayed to ease his punishment, endlessly running back and forth, using a vase to catch the acid, and then running to the cliff and pouring it out.

We rest for a night, and then Stardust takes us through another door. As we come through one of the doors we end up in some ancient-looking ruins of a city and are suddenly attacked.
