# The Celebration
The guardians of Armageddon have been invited to the palace for a celebration of treaty. I accompany King Eloissar of the Undying Lands as he enters the dining hall. The figureheads of Armageddon and the Undying Lands privately discuss for a while about how to proceed with the issue of needing Loki's help. I am designated an honorary member of the guardians of Armageddon.

# Meeting Aboard the Ship
We travel through a Nokthar to Armageddon, and during the sail back, we have a meeting. We discuss the saving of Auroria, of the diverting of the primordial comet. Currently, the guardians plan to make use of the giants' starforge to redirect the comet away. For that purpose, they've enlisted the help of Loki, who appears out of thin air during the meeting, joining in on the discussion. Fashionably late, as he might put it.

# Loki
Loki transports us to another realm/planet in which there are two armies fighting, one undead, and the other, almost completely eradicated, were humanoids. I perceive that the ship and the non-guardian people on-board are frozen in time and not in danger. Loki says that the undead multiply with every planet they conquer and are gathering strength to fight Armageddon. Some of the undead break off from the army and we engage in combat. Four of them appear behind us through a means like teleportation. After defeating them, more begin teleporting far overhead, landing on the deck of the ship and exploding into lava. I create a wall of force overhead to prevent them from landing on us.

>Andrea rescues about thirty of the soldiers of the humanoid side, but, originating from different planes and planets, we are unable to hold a conversation as we share no common tongue.

# Resolution, Sort of
We confront Loki, who retreated into the ship to where the queen of Armageddon was, and he informs us that the undead are the Necrophage, lead by the Overmind. Not providing much more information, Loki leaves, transporting us back. With chunks of infected Necrophage flesh that remained on the ship, we begin looking into the cause behind the affliction.

>Andrea gave me a Necklace of Adaptability, an Ioun Stone, and a Robe of Blending.
