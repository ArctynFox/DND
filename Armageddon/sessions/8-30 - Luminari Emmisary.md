# Trouble at the Arena
`I've lived in Armageddon for about a week now in a house that was gifted to me by Braxton.`

>We are at my housewarming party, when suddenly a messenger bird flies in and warns us that there is trouble at the arena. Assuming it to be of immediate import, I teleport us all near the arena.

I and Andrea fly us into the arena over the top. The people there recognize us and begin cheering. In the arena, we see a giant, armored/mechanical humanoid with a person sitting on its shoulder.

The man waves his hand and a giant televised view of him appears in the air. His voice echoes through the colosseum, amplified by magic. "There you are, renowned Guardian masters, ambassadors of Armageddon". He introduces himself as Teyarathock. He tells us that he is from a planet called Luminara, and that he is a weapons dealer.

# Teyarathock
Jarod responds to him, and his voice as well is amplified. Jarod welcomes him to Armageddon and asks what he is here for. The man responds that he wishes to offer us his golem, the giant armor he is standing on, as a gift to forge an alliance with us. However, we must fight it first, for the sport of the arena.

Jarod responds that we don't have the power to accept the alliance, but that we can arrange a meeting with the king and queen.

We commence combat with the golem. After a decent battle, the golem deactivates and the crowd cheers.

Teyarathock moves over to us and compliments our battle. We ask him where he is from, but he says that's best left for another time.
