# Undead Amassing
*Undead come in droves through the Nokthars. Many on ships and many just walking through and out of the ocean. They are uncountable. We are in a war council with Loki and members of the Armageddon militia.*

Jared and Andrea teleport to Equoia to talk to Sirenun of the Elven Council and see if we can enlist their aid. I also report to King Eloissar of the Undying Lands. King Eloissar sympathizes with my request and agrees to assemble an army to assist, but adds that he is also unsure how to deal with the threat in a more meaningful way. As a final addendum, he states that my utmost mission from now on will be protecting Ambrosia.

Andrea reports that she went to the other side of the Nokthar and was able to slow them down by burning many of their ships.

At the end of the day, we all report back to the war council room.

The next day, Greyfalcon ascertains the status of the other location that undead were reported to be appearing, and enlists the aid of Heimdallr to fight them while they not yet at full force.

Yet another day later, we head off to Equoia to fight a leader-looking Balor that Andrea spotted within the amassing force. When we arrive there, the Starrunner and the Undying Land elves are locked in naval battle against the undead army.

We managed to bring it down without much struggle. I take on the form of a bronze dragon and use acid breath to melt away the rest of the undead army. Then, we return to Armageddon and rest.

# The Stillness
As we are gathered the next day, a projection of the queen appears before us, consoling us on the current events. She tells that the Dark Heart has now passed to Ambrosia, but could be taken control of if someone else claims the throne of Armageddon. She also states that the lack of a person capable of properly using the Dark Heart will allow great evil to bring harm to the city. She then bestows upon us the headdress that contains the Dark Heart, telling us to keep it concealed until Ambrosia comes of age. She then explains that Ambrosia will be the last queen of Armageddon, not because it will fall, but because Ambrosia is a timeless existence who will outlast all. Then, the projection disappears.

Suddenly, Braxton, holding Ambrosia, appears before us as well. They had been placed into the Between by Loki to protect them from the current events, but it is not immediately necessary. We explain the situation to him, and then all head to the castle. As we are heading there, the citizens are celebrating and seem unusually happy, which is strange as the undead invasion was not publicly announced. We ask a few citizens and they tell us that it was announced that the queen has awakened, which contradicts the projection from earlier, which would only have occurred if she had died. Even stranger, she is not Loki in disguise, as Loki himself is standing beside her. Which means that she must actually be alive.

He walks up to Braxton who is holding Ambrosia, says "I kept my word", and then disappears.
